# 2-phase-compiler
This compiler consists of 2 first phases (lexer and parser). 
At first step compiler start with the lexer and check for lexing errors in code if the code is ok we go to the second step, At this step, we check our code with grammars(i write samples in grammar.txt) and at the end print a parse tree in the console.
